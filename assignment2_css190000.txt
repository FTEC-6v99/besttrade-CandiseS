2. Go to Database -> Reverse Engineer
3. Select next all the way throughout the creation wizard
4. once the digram is created. Go to File -> export -> PDF
5. send PDF to me as part of assignment 2 requirements.

----
1. Implement missing functions in app/src/db/dao.py (https://github.com/FTEC-6v99/besttradef21/blob/main/app/src/db/dao.py) 
2. Implement domain objects for the tables (e.g., see app/src/domain/Investor.py)
